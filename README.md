# DAQ-Interface
This is part of the Northwestern Formula Racing Organization (NFR)

The NFR DAQ Interface is an application that allows team members to view and parse data in a GUI setting. We will allow users to create a customizable layout to display multiple types of graphs as they choose, and they can upload data files from the car's data in order to gain insights into the car.
